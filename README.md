### Who am I ?

Some people call me a fool, some people call me a nerd. I'm a French high school student who's fond of Maths and IT, loving problem-solving and algorithms, as well as the FOSS world.
But there's also another huge part of my life which is my love for playing saxophone for about 10 years ðŸŽ·

### My Projects

On my free time, when I'm not studying or playing saxophone, I get some time to deal with computers.
In the past, I've always started projects which had to stay in an unfinished state. I was too ambitious, and insufficiently skilled.
I'm still ambitious, I love making huge projects, but as I've got fewer and fewer time, I'm developing AND completing things, even if very often I don't have time to maintain them.

A clear exemple is [Stock Linux](https://github.com/stock-linux) which is a distro I made from scratch to learn more about Linux and package management, it was really interesting.

Nowadays I'm mainly contributing to FOSS projects when I'm asked to, experimenting with Android apps, developing websites for people and doing competitive Programming.
